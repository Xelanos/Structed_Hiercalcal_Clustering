Lieutenant van der Weijden like topic snipe general section report talk layperson perception sniping Can briefly tell report experience lot difference military sniper train western army sniper portray usually medium military sniper professional act strict rule engagement consider valuable tool battlefield able surgically target risk collateral damage medium sniper like usually unseen gunman shoot example Washington Sniper couple happen couple year ago sniper rifle scope similarity different lot difference let turn sir military use sniper Can tell function specific mission tasking typically military sniper team main task sniper use NATO army neutralising enemy personnel order sniper enemy sniper enemy command personnel communication specialist cruiser weapon command control structure use anti materiel role apart intelligence gathering covert intelligence gathering observation advice high command JUDGE ANTONETTI Interpretation Lieutenant technical begin deal complicated issue like clear special force unit question sniper special force unit sniper identical sniper classical military unit special force sniper sniper different kind different sort training different weapon different different technique employ absolutely difference witness difference sniper special force operation special force regular infantry unit task sniper write report task general sniper sniper general applicable regular unit addition special force sniper nature able operate independently enemy line usually use support direct action operation raid yeah compound support assault element JUDGE

yugoslav army produce present time conflict start use faction news report photo medium western sniper rifle experience military report Croatians somewhat assumption Serbs lot medium high cadre yugoslav army access yugoslavian army equipment croat procure weapon procure Steyr SIG Sauer JUDGE ANTONETTI Interpretation Sir look list weapon observation figure weapon Defence bring witness occasion know rifle WITNESS know picture exact weapon recognise picture yeah difference JUDGE ANTONETTI interpretation Defence certainly come matter look photograph weapon observation weapon tripods probably use sniper hide SSG weapon impression weapon use somebody stand like Lee Oswald Adelis phoen people rifle like shoot stand standing position different technique somebody crouch shooter stand shooter prone prone position standing position WITNESS photo picture rifle page report number MUNDIS page court appendix page WITNESS page weapon suitable standing shoot stand heavy kilo bit heavy stand shooting sic rifle shooting stand difference pod aid shooter prone position lie personally prefer shoot sandbag instead pod pod different kick time ssd suitable sniper rifle pod JUDGE ANTONETTI interpretation thank proceed MUNDIS Lieutenant van der Weijden let ask weapon contain appendix page subcategory rifle weapon list rifle category suitable military sniper use difference soviet approach eastern bloc approach western approach western approach sniper sniper equip bolt action rifle precise rifle general allow sniper yeah usually long range semi automatic rifle sniper western army introduction usually employ separate sniper platoon battalion level Soviets different approach Dragunov similar lot way mainly use platoon level place sniper platoon level semi automatic reach bolt action rifle course depend ammunition use question clear rifle list rifle list appendix suitable use sniping suitable Steyr SSG SIG Sauer Dragunov suitable bit overkill shoot people GSG suitable suitable snipe suitable snipe opinion semi automatic use semi automatic sniper rifle exist produce reasonable result depend look calibre rifle suitable snipe compare round times stand length casing propellant available bullet compare ammunition use Dragunov calibre times calibre long case energy leave barrel joule energy leave barrel joule big difference yard energy drop cent joule range round joule zero leave barrel big difference use ammunition concern version mounting platform night vision scope different type scope basic sight weapon open iron sight opinion certainly suitable long range shooting comparable sight rifle comparable sight basic air gun short sight line distance dioptre open feed post difficult aim long distance Lieutenant van der Weijden rifle identify suitable snipe JUDGE ANTONETTI interpretation yes Petkovic ample time ask question later want accused petkovic interpretation explanation witness rifle read calibre use WITNESS calibre use accord Jane infantry weapon produce time Mauser round old round Germans World War old actually machine gun produce Yugoslavia time soviet round produce export times NATO NATO round accord Jane infantry weapon course accused petkovic interpretation question expert possible rifle use calibre look difference calibre lower calibre fall barrel fall barrel let tell interpret millimetre use expert rifle use different type calibre big thing small hole way JUDGE ANTONETTI interpretation yes note problem Zastava Mauser millimetre NATO question ask Zastava use type ammunition different calibre difference slight type lot respect Mauser question ask wonder WITNESS maybe clear rifle produce calibre mean suitable calibre time rifle chamber different chamber long case able round rifle rifle basically chamber difference slightly big diameter JUDGE ANTONETTI interpretation Zastava rifle chamber canon Mauser type use mean come different format speak WITNESS correct MUNDIS thank President Lieutenant van der Weijden rifle list appendix indicate suitable sniping rifle knowledge use HVO believe time rifle present difficult determine exactly rifle use time incident possible determine type calibre use group rifle use incident shot instead specify rifle question sir group rifle list appendix identify suitable snipe rifle read SSG SSG model actually Dragunov let turn subsection appendix list type machine gun Can tell type machine gun suitable snipe machine gun use snipe suitable experience machine gun Dutch Army possible instead use length ammunition round feeding tray hit target long range possible possible long range hit target guarantee small chance hit question sir respect anti aircraft canyon list appendix page appendix Would suitable use sniping role suit sniper role suitable ground role efficient actually ground role use sniping role Can ask sir include machine gun type anti aircraft canon report purpose clarification case number let look certain yeah incident number case female shoot apartment shoot wall talk explosion room use large calibre able hold type explosive incendiary ammunition produce start exist anti aircraft large machine gun MUNDIS Honours President record incident incident remove schedule snipe incident base expert report reference incident result report incident incident long list report believe answer explain weapon contain report let ask short line question break deal ammunition type ammunition suitable use sniping know contain page appendix report Can briefly tell sir subcomponent bullet bullet round actually misspoke let talk round okay round consist bullet propellant shell contain propellant firing cap contain sensitive explosive material cause propellant start burn propellant explode think burn component case shell case bullet propellant case purpose clarification talk propellant layman consider propellant layperson refer propellant generally probably gunpowder gunpowder old new material Gunpowder produce lot smoke time base nitrocellulose gunpowder smoke free JUDGE ANTONETTI interpretation know exit projectile firing pin charge Could primer Could happen fact projectile exit barrel witness pull trigger firing pin release strike firing cap firing cap sort pin act hammer little bent little metal surface act anvil little explosive charge cap sort hammer anvil compression material start cause material cause flash flash start burn propellant start burn flash flash gas heat want expand push bullet casing Chamber barrel barrel rifle people James Bond movie opening scene sort diaphragm look barrel rifling push bullet stabilise bullet leave barrel process general rifle shot JUDGE ANTONETTI interpretation bullet exit barrel speed travel metre second witness depend number round course instance time standard Kalashnikov round depend course factory produce type bullet general leave barrel metre second slightly metre suitable sniper round leave barrel metre metre second zero velocity sic MUNDIS couple question ammunition judge ANTONETTI interpretation metre second mean target metre reach half second bullet travel speed WITNESS possible vacuum wind resistance air resistance different humidity altitude shot cause bullet slow gravity air resistance great range able pick tell sky slow JUDGE TRECHSEL target light second sound second bullet sound excuse excuse order target information shot light bullet sound sound bullet think sound speed sure WITNESS depend type ammunition subsonic ammunition travel speed sound bullet slow speed sound depend range shooter typically flash muzzle flash smoke speed light fast speed know bullet strike target hear sound close range metre sound shot reach simultaneously bullet little time clearly distinguish JUDGE TRECHSEL thank JUDGE ANTONETTI interpretation thank information precise Mundis necessary break ACCUSED praljak interpretation Could correct information speed sound metre second bullet travel metre second cover metre metre target difference point bullet impact bullet hit head person die hear wound certain time hear sound incapable hear sound distance metre speed sound twice speed sound interpret simultaneous sound hear thank JUDGE ANTONETTI Interpretation Witness agree accuse WITNESS agree certain point explain difference time bullet strike target sound unfortunately brain cooperate sense message brain eyesight brain person short distance short range arrive victim perception time physically physics point view arrive different time perception difficult distinguish sound yeah thing victim JUDGE TRECHSEL issue simply way victim hear sound maybe chance head bullet come completely illusory right WITNESS yes JUDGE TRECHSEL thank JUDGE ANTONETTI interpretation Mundis break break hour disposal Will hour sufficient cover incident sketch hypothesis concern weapon involve ammunition MUNDIS area talk basic information basic ballistic trajectory scope compensate matter incident good time available President JUDGE

apart army component bullet copper coating inside steel tip penetration component core small steel tip lead core bullet copper coating primarily anti oxidation lead push bullet groove right twist barrel Lieutenant van der Weijden like ask question question basic ballistic ask usher hand witness blank paper discuss yesterday day sir use big white board think easy paper everybody observe screen Can draw basic diagram trajectory bullet exit barrel rifle barrel physics main influence gravity bullet barrel start barrel barrel completely level problem cause long range bullet ground use scope sight bullet barrel compensate range sight come certain distance distance know line sight sight picture shooter completely coincide bullet trajectory mean course incorrectly judge distance metre target actually metre bullet strike target high target distance metre line sight think aim bullet actually strike lower target important sight adjust right distance explain sight adjust right distance yes explain optical sight basic shape optical sight people know tube like enlarge circle sort rubber ring hold tube tube know glass lens contain glass lens look contain radical shooter aim scope

ANTONETTI interpretation second number REGISTRAR second sketch Exhibit MUNDIS thank Lieutenant van der Weijden tell factor influence bullet leave barrel rifle travel downrange main influence gravity pull bullet earth cause bullet drop big influence mention air resistance thickness air cause friction bullet slow bullet tropical country bullet slow fast temperate climate addition air high altitude contain molecule slow bullet sea level air sea level air resistance yeah slow bullet sideways correction big influence wind cross examination yard approximately metre times round use Dragunov yard deviation slight wind small breeze push bullet way centimetre left right wind complete cross wind difference deviate wind come right come position push bullet different way course cross wind exact degree angle big inference shooting angle upwards downwards explain easily drawing shooter rifle shooter target circle measure distance like gravity pull bullet distance shoot bullet end higher sorry intend yeah Pythagorus simple calculation calculate distance set rifle distance actually distance cover bullet ballistically sign document ask number sketch Marks JUDGE ANTONETTI interpretation number REGISTRAR Honours MUNDIS thank Lieutenant van der Weijden tell step shooter compensate factor affect trajectory bullet shooter ability distance measure method nowadays use laser range finding use
